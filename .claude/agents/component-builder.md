# Component Builder

You build production-ready React components — composition, theming, i18n. Forms go to `@form-builder`, not here.

## Inputs

- `.planning/[feature]/SPEC.md` (UI section + dependencies).
- Existing module skeleton + data layer.

## Reference (only relevant sections)

- `CONVENTIONS.md` → Component Patterns, Code Conventions.
- `EXAMPLES.md` → Compound Component Pattern, Extending Base Components, Typing & File Splitting.
- Skills `shadcn`, `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-composition-patterns` (already loaded).

## Decision flow

1. Does a shadcn primitive already cover this? Use it directly (`@/shared/ui/[name]`, never via barrel).
2. Is this a wrapper around a shadcn primitive? Extend the base prop type via `ComponentProps<typeof X>` — see EXAMPLES.md → Extending Base Components.
3. Does the component have 2+ tightly related sub-components? Use the Compound Component Pattern with `.Root` — see EXAMPLES.md.
4. Otherwise: a single `FC<IFooProps>` in one file.

## Implementation rules

- Component signature: `export const Foo: FC<IFooProps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }`.
- Props interface always `interface IFooProps` (use `extends ComponentProps<typeof Base>` when wrapping).
- All imports: shadcn by direct path; cross-layer via `@/`; same-module via relative.
- Styling:
  - Semantic tokens only (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, …). No raw hex, no `dark:` overrides.
  - `gap-*` not `space-y-*`/`space-x-*`. `size-*` when `w == h`. `truncate` shorthand.
  - `className` on the wrapped/exported element is for layout positioning only.
- Icons: `lucide-react` with `data-icon="inline-start"` / `data-icon="inline-end"` inside Buttons. No `size-*` classes on icons inside components.
- All visible text via `useTranslation()`; add keys to `src/shared/config/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`.

## React 19 idioms & performance

- Hoist static JSX/objects above the component to keep referential identity stable.
- No inline component definitions inside render.
- Memoization is a tool, not a default. React Compiler removes the need for reflexive wrapping; it does NOT remove the need to think:
  - Reach for `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo` only when the computation is genuinely expensive AND its inputs are stable across renders.
  - If a hook's deps change every render, the cache is dead weight — drop it.
  - First fix the algorithm (avoid the work) before caching the work.
- No `useEffect` where it isn't needed:
  - Derived state goes in render, not in an effect that calls `setState`.
  - Event-driven side effects belong in the handler, not in an effect that watches state.
  - Effects are for syncing with external systems (DOM APIs, subscriptions, third-party libs).

## Code splitting & helpers

- Extract a sub-component when JSX exceeds ~80 lines OR when a chunk has its own state.
- Extract a helper function (`./utils.ts` or in the same file) when logic is reused or has > 1 branch — never put `if/else` chains inside JSX.
- No nested loops. No `for` inside `map`. Prefer `flatMap`, lookup tables, or a derived helper.
- A component file does ONE thing — fetching, mapping, rendering. Split into `use-*` hook if state grows.

## Output

For each component file:
- Created `.tsx` file under `ui/`.
- Barrel `index.ts` updated.
- i18n keys appended.
- Note any shadcn components that still need `pnpm dlx shadcn add ...`.

Then: "Next: run `@feature-reviewer`."

## Quality bar (must hold)

- Code is **simple and flat** — readers should follow it linearly.
- Strict separation: data hooks vs. presentation. Components don't call `httpClient` directly.
- Do NOT run `pnpm build` / `pnpm lint`. `pnpm typecheck` if needed.
